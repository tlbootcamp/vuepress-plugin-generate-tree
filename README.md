## Sorry, plugin for what?
In our [Teamlead Roadmap](https://github.com/tlbootcamp/tlroadmap) we wanted to generate a tree with pages structure and meta-data.

It is very useful for automatically build sidebar, and vuepress community has [plugin](https://github.com/shanyuhai123/vuepress-plugin-auto-sidebar) for it. But we need not only sidebar, but also meta-data, exporting to file, special ordering, so we decided to create a new specific plugin ðŸ™„ (yes, [NIH syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here))

Main idea of Teamlead Roadmap is maintaining big mindmap with teamleader's competencies and roles based on VuePress site generator. Web-interface is a good place for beginning, but people want use other mindmap tools and generating other artifacts is a necessity for us. Plugin solves this problem and generate tree of pages with metadata from frontmatter and $page object.
